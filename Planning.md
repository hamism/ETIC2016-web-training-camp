##Planning of the "web course" of ETIC training camp 2016

Hi,here below i've listed the steps that we'll be following(hopefullay hhh) during the "ETIC 2016 Training Camp".

#### Step 1: Ask for attendee names and domain of study or field of work
What is your name, and that kind of questions.

#### Step 2: Have a little discussion with every single member
Break the ice between the trainer and the attendees and talking a little bit about what they know about web developmont so we can form balanced teams(2 members) later.

#### Step 3: Teams creation
Creation of balanced teams.

#### Step4: A general overview about the  project
Talk about the high level functionalities that we'll be implementing without technical details.

#### Step5: Conceptual part of the project
Talk about the conceptual part of the project, and what data we'll be using.

#### Step 6: Introduce some important concepts.
Introduce concepts and jargons like ``web``,``server`` etc.
Talk about the used languages
for both front-end & back-end of the project with some illustrations to clarify the picture.

#### Step 7: Talk about the "tools" part
 Introduce the tools that we'll be using.

####Tools.
* [Sublime text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) as the code editor, you can use your editor of choice but you'll probably  make us a little bit slower.
* For server side language(PHP), web server(Apache) and Database server (MySQL) we picked :
  - [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for linux users.
  - [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) for Mac users.
  - [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/) for Windows users.


Other details will be added as we go through the project.
